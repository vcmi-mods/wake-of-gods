356	[<POSITION=C>]You cannot change an artifact option

357	You cannot give an artifact to a stack because the experience system is disabled.
358	Creatures cannot use this artifact.
359	This stack has an Artifact already.
360	Cannot add artifact (internal reason).
361	[<POSITION=C>]This Artifact gives the following bonus:
%s

If you want to change it, click the Right mouse button.
362	Stack may have an artifact that improves its experience abilities (to pass it to a Stack drop it on a stack slot in Hero's army)
363	[<POSITION=C>]Stack may have an artifact that improves its experience abilities
(to pass it to Stack drop it on a stack slot in Hero's army)
364	Current Bonus : %s (Left click to pass to Hero, Right click to change Artifact option)
365	This bonus gives the stack additional ammo in combat so that it can
continue to use its ranged attack for more rounds.
366	This bonus gives the stack additional spell castings for each combat.
For example, an Archangel may be able to resurrect more than once per
combat; a Phoenix may be able to rebirth a second time, etc.
367	This bonus gives the stack the Fear ability. Enemy stacks that aren't
immune to Fear have a chance of temporarily freezing each round, and
missing their turn.
368	This bonus gives the stack additional retaliations so that it can
retaliate against multiple attacks in the same round.
369	This bonus gives the stack an additional temporary increase to Defense
if it takes the Defend action. This bonus is in addition to the
standard bonus when Defending.
370	This bonus gives the stack extra Magic Resistance. This is "dwarf-style"
magic resistance, so the stack has a chance of resisting a spell
completely, but still takes full effect if it fails to resist.
This resistance is added to any Magic Resistance the stack already has.
371	This bonus gives the stack resistance to damage-based spell attacks.
This is "golem-style" magic resistance so it reduces the damage
of an attack by a certain percentage.
372	This bonus removes the normal range penalty for a stack when it makes
a ranged attack at long range.
373	This bonus removes the normal obstacle penalty for a stack when it makes
a ranged attack over a castle wall.
374	This bonus gives the stack the Fly ability. Flying stacks can move
freely across the battlefield, ignoring walls, obstacles
and other stacks in their path.
375	This bonus gives the stack the Shooting ability. Shooting stacks can make
attacks at a distance and suffer no retaliation when doing so.
376	This bonus gives the stack the Breath attack ability. A Breath attack
is a melee attack that has a range (depth) of two hexes, allowing it
to affect two creatures, one behind the other. Use caution when
planning attacks because a friendly stack behind an attacked enemy
stack will also be affected.

Note: if a stack has both this ability and an Attack All Around ability,
the Breath attack will not function.
377	This bonus makes the stack Alive. Stacks that are Alive can be resurrected
by the Resurrection spell.
378	This bonus designates the stack as being in the King 1 category.
This means that it is susceptible to the Basic Slayer spell.
379	This bonus designates the stack as being in the King 2 category.
This means that it is susceptible to the Advanced Slayer spell.
380	This bonus designates the stack as being in the King 3 category.
This means that it is susceptible to the Expert Slayer spell.
381	This bonus gives the stack immunity to all Mind spells,
including beneficial Mind spells such as Frenzy and Mirth.
382	This bonus removes the normal melee penalty that most shooting stacks
have when making a melee attack. 
383	This bonus gives the stack immunity to all Fire spells,
including beneficial Fire spells such as Bloodlust.
384	This bonus gives the stack the Double Strike ability. Each time the stack makes
an attack (ranged or melee), it strikes its target twice instead of once.
385	This bonus gives the stack the No Retaliation ability. When it makes an attack,
the target stack is unable to make a retaliation attack in return.
386	This bonus makes the stack unaffected by Morale. The stack will always have
neutral Morale and will never have Morale bonuses or penalties in combat.
387	This bonus makes the stack Undead. Undead stacks cannot be resurrected
but can be brought back to "unlife" by the Animate Dead spell.
Undead stacks may also be immune to certain spells and effects.
388	This bonus gives the stack the ability to Attack All Around itself.
Each time it makes a melee attack, all adjacent creatures are attacked at once.

Note: if a stack has both this ability and a Breath attack,
the Breath attack will not function.
389	This bonus designates the stack as having a Dragon Nature. This means
the stack will gain bonuses from artifacts that normally grant bonuses
only to Dragons, e.g., the Vial of Dragon's Blood.
390	This bonus gives the stack the Strike and Return ability. This lets the
stack return to its starting hex after making a melee attack (assuming it moved).
To disable Strike and Return and make a normal non-returning attack,
right-click the Defend button and make your selection from the options listed.
You can change this again at any time.
391	This bonus gives the stack the Champion Charge ability. This ability
adds 5% additional damage to the stack's melee attack for each hex it
moves to reach its target.
392	This bonus gives the stack Always Positive Morale. This means that its
Morale will never be less than +1, even if it would normally be lower.
393	This bonus gives the stack the ability to Shoot when Adjacent. This means
that the stack can never have its range attack "blocked" by
the presence of an adjacent enemy stack.
394	This bonus makes the stack Fearless. A Fearless stack will never freeze in fear
due to the presence of an enemy stack with the Fear ability.
395	This bonus gives the stack the Rebirth ability. This means that a percentage of
the stack will resurrect itself automatically after the entire stack has been
killed. The number of times this resurrection may occur each combat
depends on the number of spell castings per combat the stack has.
396	This bonus gives the stack the Unicorn's Aura of Resistance. This aura bestows
a bonus of 20% Magic Resistance to all adjacent friendly stacks.
397	This bonus gives the stack a chance of completely Blocking any physical attack
(melee or ranged). A Blocked attack inflicts no damage on the stack.
398	This bonus Reduces the Casting Cost of spells for the owner of the stack.
Regardless of reductions, all spells still cost a minimum of one spell point to cast.
399	This bonus gives the stack a chance of dealing a Double Damage Death Blow.
If a Death Blow occurs, it simply doubles the damage inflicted by the
stack on its target.
400	This bonus lets the stack do additional damage to a specific creature.
The damage done is increased by a percentage that may be higher at higher ranks.
401	This bonus gives the stack the ability to Regenerate lost health for the
topmost creature. This may occur automatically or there may be only a
chance of it occurring each round. The maximum amount of Health
regenerated may vary by creature and rank obtained.
402	This bonus gives the stack a chance of casting a non-direct damage spell
or affect immediately after making its attack. Spell effects last
for three rounds only.

Note: this chance is in addition to a creature's natural spell 
effect (if any), even if only one effect occurs per round.
For example, a War Unicorn will have its normal 20% chance 
to cast Blind, followed by any chance of casting the spell
it gained through stack experience.
403	This bonus gives the stack a chance of casting a spell at expert level
prior to making its attack. Non-mass spells are cast against the target
of the creature's normal attack. If the spell has a "mass" version,
it will be cast as such, affecting all friendly stacks if a beneficial
spell, or all enemy stacks if a harmful spell. Note: some spells that
normally affect ALL creatures on the battlefield may continue to do so.
For example, Armageddon would affect all creatures, friend or foe.
404	This bonus gives the stack a chance of casting a spell at basic or advanced
level prior to making its attack. Spells are cast against the target
of the creature's normal attack.  Note: some spells that normally 
affect ALL creatures on the battlefield may continue to do so.
For example, Armageddon would affect all creatures, friend or foe.
405	This bonus gives the stack a chance of casting a spell at expert level
after making its attack. Non-mass spells are cast against the target of
the creature's normal attack. If the spell has a "mass" version, it
will be cast as such, affecting all friendly stacks if a beneficial
spell, or all enemy stacks if a harmful spell.  Note: some spells that
normally affect ALL creatures on the battlefield may continue to do so.
For example, Armageddon would affect all creatures, friend or foe.

Note: this chance is in addition to a creature's natural spell effect 
(if any), even if only one effect occurs per round. For example, a 
War Unicorn will have its normal 20% chance to cast Blind, followed 
by any chance of casting the spell it gained through stack experience.
406	This bonus gives the stack a chance of casting a spell at basic or advanced
level after making its attack. Spells are cast against the target
of the creature's normal attack.  Note: some spells that normally 
affect ALL creatures on the battlefield may continue to do so.
For example, Armageddon would affect all creatures, friend or foe.

Note: this chance is in addition to a creature's natural spell effect 
(if any), even if only one effect occurs per round. For example, a 
War Unicorn will have its normal 20% chance to cast Blind, followed 
by any chance of casting the spell it gained through stack experience.
407	This bonus Enchants the stack with a spell for the duration of the combat.
If the spell is dispelled, it will be renewed the following round.
The level of spell may vary by rank, and for certain creatures, their
spell Enchantments may even affect ALL friendly stacks once the stack
reaches a high enough rank.
408	w undefined yet ability (reserved)
409	This bonus gives the stack the ability to temporarily Reduce the target's
Defense. When attacking another stack, it reduces the target's Defense by a
certain percentage before calculating damage. This lasts for the duration
of the attack only.
410	This bonus gives the stack an increase to its Death Stare ability, with a
higher per creature chance of success. The net result is that the
Death Stare becomes more effective, killing more enemies than before.
411	This bonus lets the stack Deflect part of an attack. This means that the
damage done will be reduced by a percentage. Damage reduction may
increase at higher ranks.

Note: the reduction to damage will NOT be shown in the combat text display
but will be applied correctly to the Deflecting stack.
412	This bonus gives the stack a chance of Deflecting part of an attack.
If the stack successfully Deflects an attack, the damage done will be
reduced by a certain percentage. The chance of Deflecting an attack may
increase at higher ranks.

Note: the reduction to damage will NOT be shown in the combat text display
but will be applied correctly to the Deflecting stack.
413	This bonus gives upgraded creatures as guards to Santa Gremlins
instead of the normal non-upgraded creatures.
414	This bonus increases the number of guards in
each stack guarding the Santa Gremlins.
415	This bonus gives the stack the ability to automatically summon a stack of
creatures to the battlefield. Summoned stacks will begin appearing on the
second round of combat as long as an unoccupied adjacent hex is available.
The size of the summoned stack is calculated as a percentage of the size
of the summoning stack.

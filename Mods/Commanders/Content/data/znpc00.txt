185	You need a Magic Guild of level 3 to revive your Commander	
Description of NPC Types-Paladin	As a divine defender of justice, this holy avenger's abilities grow stronger with every battle won. The Paladin has also been blessed with healing magic to keep the troops alive and fighting strong.	
187-Hierophant	These mystical Commanders are natural healers, always insisting on at least one first aid tent for any army they command. In battle, they protect the lives of their troops by conjuring a magical shield to ward off deadly blows.	
188-Temple Guardian	Strong willed and intelligent, the beautiful Temple Guardian is a distant cousin to the titans. Her presence on the battlefield improves the ranged accuracy of titans as well as the other troops she commands. This power is almost as useful as her innate ability to draw forth and channel mana from an emotionally-charged field of battle.	
189-Succubus	Always sensual and charming, your ranks will soon swell with creatures entranced under this demonic Commander's spell. The Succubus' affinity for fire lets her protect her minions with an aura of flame.	
190-Soul Eater	These soulless Commanders absorb the spiritual essence of the creature they kill to sustain them in their unnatural unlife. On the battlefield, the Soul Eater uses her necromantic powers to reanimate her fallen undead comrades.	
191-Brute	A fearless fighter in battle, this Commander inspires bloodlust in the troops he or she commands. And when it's all over, the Brute directs the army to gather up the corpses, for there is always a demand for fresh bodies in the dark and smelly depths of the dungeon.	
192-Ogre Leader	The resourceful Ogre Leaders have fallen in love with the deadly ballista and always make sure there's at least one in any army they command. These cunning Commanders have also mastered a spell that makes their troops' skin as hard as stone.	
193-Shaman	This adept Commander uses primal magic to become much stronger in battle, drawing upon the spiritual totem of the hero who leads the army. The Shaman's spells increase both the speed and reflexes of the Fortress beasts to which he or she is attuned.	
194-Astral Spirit	Originating on the astral plane, this Commander's ability to reveal glimpses of an empty and desolate world often make the once-loyal soldiers of sworn enemies cast down their weapons, having seen the futility of war. The Astral Spirit also possesses telepathy and can sometimes warn friendly troops of a surprise attack from behind.
